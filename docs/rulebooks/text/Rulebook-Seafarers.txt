        OBJECTIVE
        Seafarers scenarios present you with new goals and paths to victory. Reach that goal during your turn to win the game.

        PRODUCTION PHASE
        GOLD FIELDS
        Each player with a settlement on a gold field hex that produces this turn receives 1 resource card of
        their choice (brick, wood, wool, wheat, or ore). Similarly, a player receives 2 resource cards
        in any combination for each of their cities on that hex.
                                                                                                                        Gold fields produce

        When you roll a 7, you may choose to move the pirate instead of the robber. Move the pirate
        to the frame or to a new sea hex. If you move it to a sea hex, choose one player with a ship on
        that hex and steal 1 random resource card from them.                                                                   OR

           MOVE A SHIP
           You may move 1 ship during your Action phase with the following restrictions:
            • You may not move a ship you built this turn.
            • You may only move a ship if one of its two ends is “open.” A ship’s end is
               “open” when it is not next to one of your ships or buildings.
            • You may not move a ship that is a part of a continuous line of ships connecting
               two of your buildings, even if another player’s building is built on that line to
               interrupt it.                                                                         Example: Red may move any of

           obeying all the usual rules for ship placement.

           Longest Route
           The first player to have 5 continuous roads and/or ships in play receives the Longest Route tile. If another player has
           more continuous roads and/or ships in play, they immediately receive this tile. The Longest Route tile is worth 2 VPs.
           Roads and ships are only considered part of the same route if they connect to each other at one of your buildings.
                                                                        Example: Orange has a two-segment route made up of roads

SCENARIOS
The scenarios in this epic campaign offer a unique blend of challenges and opportunities for you to explore.
The first four scenarios focus on the basic rules of Seafarers. Their gameplay is simpler.

Each scenario has its own setup, rules, and victory condition, along with recommendations on how to add variety
to the game. We recommend playing the fixed setup for each scenario first, as it provides a balanced board.
There are different maps and component lists for 3-players           and 4-players                                              . In addition, take note
of the following setup changes:

 1 Assemble the Frame
Turn over the frame pieces from CATAN so that you do not see any coastline or ports.
Then use these frame pieces and the ones from Seafarers to construct the frame
according to the map for the scenario you are playing.
Note: It is easier to assemble the frame by placing the CATAN frame pieces down onto
the Seafarers frame pieces. If done the other way around, additional force may be
required, and you may damage the frame pieces.

 2 Place the Hexes, Number Discs, and Ports
Place the hexes and number discs in the frame according to the scenario map.
Then place ports according to the scenario map. Some scenarios have you place ports face up randomly on the board
as shown by the question mark on a blank port: ?
                                                                                                                                                               SETUP




 3 Place Your Starting Pieces
Place your starting pieces using the method described under “Variable Setup” in CATAN. If you place a starting
settlement on the coast, you may place a ship on an adjacent empty sea edge instead of a road.

                                                                                                                                                           3
HEADING FOR NEW SHORES
You have finally settled on the island and can call Catan your home. With this newfound peace
comes a renewed ambition, a yearning from the younger generation to set sail and explore
the surrounding islands.
FIXED SETUP
    ¥ Set up the game as shown by the appropriate map. Place the robber and the pirate on the indicated locations.
     Areas outlined in dark blue are the small islands. The remaining area is referred to as the main island.
    ¥ Your starting settlements with roads/ships must be placed on the main island.

ADDITIONAL RULES
Each time you build your first settlement
on a small island, you earn an
additional 2 VPs. Take 2 VP tokens
and place them under the
settlement when you build it. You
may receive the additional
 2 VPs for each of the small
islands—it does not matter if
other players have already
built settlements on
that island.
WINNING
THE GAME
If you have 14 or
more VPs at any
point during your
turn, the game ends
and you are
the winner!

THE FOUR ISLANDS
The distant archipelago looked like an insignificant cluster of dots on the horizon, but once you got
close, its value became clear. This collection of new, uninhabited islands will make an excellent hub
for future seafaring expeditions.
FIXED SETUP
    ¥ Set up the game as shown by the appropriate map. Place the robber and the pirate on the indicated locations.

    ¥ Your starting settlements with roads/ships may be placed on one island or two different islands. These location(s) are
     your home islands. The remaining islands are unexplored for you. Each player may have different home and
     unexplored islands.
ADDITIONAL RULES
Each time you build your first
settlement on an unexplored
island, you earn an additional
2 VPs. Take 2 VP tokens and
place them under the
settlement when you build
it. It is possible to receive
2 VPs for each
unexplored island—it
does not matter if
other players have
already built
settlements on
that island.
WINNING

If you have 13 or
more VPs at any
point during your

VARIABLE SETUP
Set up the frame for a 3- or 4-player game. Then place sea hexes as shown on the map. Gather the land hexes and
number discs and place them randomly in the four island areas. Make sure forests and pastures do not get low value
number discs (2, 3, 11, and 12).
You may also randomize the ports. Shuffle the port tokens and place them on the port locations shown on the map.
Finally, place the robber on the hex with the number 12 disc and the pirate on the indicated location.




                                                                                                                                   7
THE FOG ISLANDS
A heavy fog separates these islands, making it difficult for their inhabitants to communicate with one
another. You’ll need a brave seafarer to explore the passage and map out what lies within.
FIXED SETUP
    ¥ Set up the game as shown by the appropriate map. The white spaces are left empty. Randomize the facedown hexes
      from the component list and place them in a facedown stack next to the board. Do the same with the facedown
      number discs from the component list. Place the robber and the pirate on the indicated locations.
    ¥ Your starting settlements with roads/ships may be placed on one island or two different islands.

ADDITIONAL RULES
When you place a ship or road
adjacent to an intersection with an
empty hex space, you discover a
new location. Take the top hex
from the facedown stack
and place it face up in the
empty space.
If it is a land hex, take
a random number
disc from the
facedown pile and
place it on the hex.
Take 1 resource
card of the type
produced by
that hex.
If the new hex is a
sea hex, do not
place a number disc
and do not take
a resource.
WINNING
THE GAME
If you have 12 or more VPs at
any point during your turn, the
game ends and you are the winner!

VARIABLE SETUP
Set up the frame for a 3- or 4-player game. Place sea hexes as shown on the map. Gather the faceup land hexes and
number discs and place them randomly in the two island areas shown on the map. Red number discs (6s and 8s) are
allowed to end up next to each other in this case.
Port locations must remain as shown, but you may randomize which specific port appears in these port locations.
Finally, place the robber on the number 12 disc and the pirate on the indicated location.




                                                                                                                                 9
THROUGH THE DESERT
The Desert Island is named after both the large desert that splits it and its infamous lack of resources.
You will need to be resourceful and find supplies by either exploring the neighboring islands to the
east or risk a journey across the desert.
FIXED SETUP
 ¥ Set up the game as shown by the appropriate map. Place the robber and the pirate on the indicated locations.

 ¥ The desert divides the largest island into a small land strip (outlined in green) and a larger set of hexes (the main
     island). Your starting settlements with roads/ships must be placed on the main island. The small islands (outlined in
     dark blue) and the small land strip are unexplored regions.
ADDITIONAL RULES
Each time you build your first settlement
in an unexplored region, you earn an
additional 2 VPs. Take 2 VP tokens
and place them under the
settlement when you build it.
It is possible to receive 2 VPs
for each unexplored region–it
does not matter if other
players have already
built settlements in
that region.
WINNING
THE GAME
If you have 14 or more
VPs at any point
during your turn, the
game ends and you
are the winner!

THE FORGOTTEN TRIBE
Seafaring can be very dangerous, and not all expeditions make it back. Such was the
case for the forgotten tribe. Fortunately, after years of searching, you finally found
them and learned that they are alive and well. Many of them are happy to stay,
but others want to return home and have asked for safe passage back to Catan.
FIXED SETUP
 ¥ Set up the game as shown by the map.

     • Place the robber on any desert hex and the pirate on the indicated location.
     • Place the 8 VP tokens on the indicated edges.
     • Without looking at them, place the 4 topmost cards from the development card
       deck face down on the indicated edges.
     • Without looking at them, randomly place ports face up in the locations shown
       on the map.
 ¥ Your starting settlements with roads/ships must be placed on the large island.

ADDITIONAL RULES
You may only build settlements on hexes with a number disc. Similarly, the
robber may only be moved to a hex with a number disc (whether due to a 7 roll
or a Knight card).
VP TOKENS
When you build or move one of your ships onto an edge with a VP token,
take the token and place it in front of you. Each VP token is worth 1 VP.
DEVELOPMENT CARDS
When you build or move one of your ships to an edge with a development card,
take the card. Use it as if you bought it this turn (i.e., you may play it on a future
turn or immediately reveal it to win the game).
PORTS
When you build or move one of your ships onto an edge with a port, take the faceup port.
If possible, place the port face up next to one of your coastal settlements. However, there
must always be one edge between ports. If you do not have a valid option for placing the
port (i.e., no coastal settlement or no valid edge for a port), set the port in front of you
until you have a valid option.
Ports may be used immediately upon being placed.
WINNING THE GAME
If you have 13 or more VPs at any point during your turn, the game ends and you are the winner!

for the large island and place them randomly in the center of the map.
Note: The 3 hexes outlined in blue on the right side of the large island should not receive the number discs 5, 6, 8, or 9.
Place the robber on a desert. Then place the pirate, ports, VP tokens, and development cards on the indicated locations.

CLOTH FOR CATAN
Catanian settlements are bursting with activity, becoming
too crowded for cloth artists to hone their craft. As such,
many have opted to lead lives of isolation and build
new homes in the neighboring islets. This increases
both their productivity and the value of their craft to
you and your fellow Catanians.
FIXED SETUP
 ¥ Set up the game as shown by the map. The
   8 number discs on the four small islands
   represent villages that produce cloth for trade.
   Place 5 cloth tokens next to each village. Place
   the remaining 10 cloth tokens next to the
   board to form a general supply.
 ¥ Place the robber and pirate on the
   indicated locations.
 ¥ Your starting settlements with roads/
   ships may be placed on one of the large
   islands or split across both large islands.
   For this scenario, place 3 starting
   settlements. Your first 2 settlements
   are placed as in CATAN; however, you
   do not collect any resources. Players
   then place a third settlement and road/
   ship beginning with the first player and
   proceeding clockwise around the table.
   Take your starting resources based on your
   third settlement.
 ¥ Return the Longest Route tile to the box.
   It is not used in this scenario.
ADDITIONAL RULES
You may not build settlements on the small islands.

VARIABLE SETUP
Set up the frame, the four small islands, and sea hexes as shown. Set up the villages by placing the number discs
and cloth tokens as shown.
Gather the land hexes and number discs for the large islands and place them randomly in the empty hex areas.
Randomly place ports on the locations shown.
Players choose which hex with a number 12 disc should start the game with the robber. Then place the pirate
on the indicated location.

THE PIRATE ISLANDS
The pirates have grown in force and launched a surprise attack on the
neighboring islands. These battle-hardened buccaneers are sinking your ships,
stealing resources, capturing settlements, and threatening to expand East.
You must build a navy to stop these audacious pirates before it’s too late.
SETUP
 ¥ Set up the game as shown by the map. Note that there are 6 hexes that do not
   receive a number token.
 ¥ Place one settlement and one ship of each color on the coast of the main
   (easternmost) island as shown. You may build on the main island as normal.
   The remaining islands are considered pirate islands.
 ¥ Create 4 pirate fortresses on the western islands by stacking 3 pirate lair
   tokens and 1 settlement and placing them in the locations shown. Place the
   beachhead markers as shown. In a 3-player game, do not use the white
   piece locations.
Note: Pirate fortresses do not produce resources.
 ¥ The development card deck: For a 3-player game, remove the Victory Point
   cards, returning them to the box. For a 4-player game, treat the Victory Point
   cards as Knight cards.
 ¥ Return the Longest Route and Largest Army tiles to the box.

 ¥ Return the robber to the box. Place the pirate on the indicated location.

 ¥ Place your two starting settlements with roads/ships on the main island. In this way,
   each player starts the game with 3 settlements.

THE WONDERS OF CATAN
After the pirate fleet was defeated, peace returned to the island. The many years of
prosperity that followed brought forth a new ambition to create the greatest structure
in Catanian history, thus beginning the race to build the first “Wonder of Catan.”
FIXED SETUP
 ¥ Set up the game as shown by the map.

 ¥ Your starting settlements with roads/ships must be placed on the large island. They
   may not be placed on an intersection with a Great Bridge or Great Wall marker or on
   intersections with “X” markers next to the Great Bridge markers.
 ¥ Place the wonder tiles next to the game board.

 ¥ Place the robber on a desert hex. Return the pirate to the box. It is not used
   in this scenario.
 ¥ Take the wonder marker in your player color.

ADDITIONAL RULES
BUILDING ON SMALL ISLANDS
Each time you build your first settlement on a small island, you earn
1 additional VP. Take 1 VP token and place it under the settlement when you
build it. You may receive 1 VP for each of the small islands—it does not matter
if other players have already built settlements on that island.
BUILDING THE WONDERS OF CATAN
Before you can begin a wonder, you must meet the requirements shown on its
tile. When you do so, you may claim it by taking the tile and placing it in front of
you. No other player may then claim or build that wonder. You may only claim
1 wonder.
To start building a wonder, pay the cost shown at the top of the tile, then place your
wonder marker on space 1.
Each of the four levels of a wonder costs the same 5 resources to build. You may build
as many levels on a turn as you want and can afford. Each time you build a level, move
your wonder marker to the next level (from 1 to 2, 2 to 3, etc.). When you reach level 4, your
wonder is complete.
WINNING THE GAME
You win if, during your turn, you:
     • Finish building your Wonder of Catan, OR
     • Have 10 or more VPs and have completed a higher level of your wonder than any other player.
VARIABLE SETUP
Set up the frame. Then place desert, small island, and sea hexes within the frame as shown.
MAIN ISLAND
Gather the main island land hexes, number discs, and ports. Place them randomly in the area outlined in blue on the map.
Note: The 2 land hexes next to the desert should not receive red number discs (6s and 8s).
Finally, place the robber on one of the desert hexes.

SETUP
  ¥ Gather the hexes listed and randomly place them face up within the frame.
    Players may take this opportunity to agree to shift the setup of the hexes if
    they would like to change the number or size of islands.
  ¥ Gather the number discs listed and randomly place them on the land
    hexes. If 2 red number discs end up on adjacent hexes, swap one of
    them with an adjacent black number hex so that all the red number discs
    are separated.
  ¥ Players then take turns placing a random port face up on the board.

      • Place the port tokens on edges between a land and sea hex or between
         a land hex and a frame piece. Place the robber and pirate on the indicated
         locations.
      • When placing a port token, stay at least one edge away from all other port tokens.
  ¥ Your starting settlements with roads/ships may be placed on one island or two different islands. These location(s)
    are your home islands. The remaining islands are unexplored for you. Each player may have different home and
    unexplored islands.
