# Agent Guide

This file defines how coding agents should operate in this repository.

## Scope

- Treat this file as the default operating guide for all tasks.
- For frontend asset work, also follow `ui/README.md` scripts and conventions.

## DOCs

- For work on game assets look at ui/ASSET_SPEC.md

- After changes, if necessary, update docs and testing.


### If ambiguous

- Ask one concise clarification question with 2-3 options.
- If confidence is high (>80%), proceed and report assumptions.
