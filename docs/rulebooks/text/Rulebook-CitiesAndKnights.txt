CITIES & KNIGHTS
                                                    INTRODUCTION
  Trouble is brewing off the shores of Catan. Though your thriving communities have begun to grow
  into majestic cities, your success and wealth have caught the attention of marauding invaders.
  To ensure the collective security of the island, you must stand together and muster an army of
  the bravest knights.
  Maintaining an army while also advancing your society is no simple task, but the greatest leaders
  thrive on a good challenge!




  CATAN® – Cities & Knights Expansion™ (aka Cities & Knights) is an expansion to CATAN – The Game™ (aka CATAN).
  Cities & Knights uses the same rules as CATAN with a few additions:
                               A revised turn structure • New build options, including city walls and knights
                              Commodities and progress cards • City improvement options • Barbarians!

               TURN OVERVIEW
               Cities & Knights uses all the rules from CATAN with the following additions. You play over a series of turns, starting with
               the first player, and moving clockwise around the table. Each turn consists of three phases, which occur in this order:
                         1. Roll Dice phase
                         2. Production phase
                         3. Action phase
               Once you have finished the Action phase, if you have not won, pass the dice to the player on your left.
               They begin their turn with the Roll Dice phase.

City walls are placed under cities. Each city may only have 1 wall.
City walls increase the number of cards you may keep
when a 7 is rolled. Each city wall adds 2 to the number
you may hold before having to discard.                                                       Example: Blue has built 2 city

               player to reach level 4 or level 5 on a track, take the matching metropolis piece and place it on one of your
               cities. You may control multiple metropolises, but each one must be placed on a different one of your cities.
               If you do not have an available city, you may not purchase the level 4 (or level 5) improvement.

               Control of a metropolis is worth 2 VP, so a city with a metropolis is worth a total of 4 VP.
               Metropolises affect the barbarian attack in two ways (see “Barbarians Attack” on page 11):
                • Each metropolis on the board adds to the barbarians’ strength.

             In a single turn, you may recruit a knight and then activate it, or you may take a

             you may not activate a knight and then take an action with it on the same turn.

Knight Actions
Knights that are active at the beginning of your Action
phase may perform one of three actions:
Move a Knight
Move an active knight to an empty intersection with the
following restrictions:
  • You may only move along your continuous routes.
  • You may move past intersections occupied by your
     pieces (buildings and knights), but not other
     players’ pieces.
  • You must stop your movement on a connected,
     empty intersection.                                       Example: White’s knight may move to either of the

BARBARIANS ATTACK
When the barbarian ship reaches the end of the barbarian track (       ), it attacks. Complete the following steps in order:
DETERMINE THE BARBARIANS’
AND DEFENDERS’ STRENGTHS                                Example: The barbarians’ total strength is 5 (5 cities). The
  • The barbarians’ strength is equal to the            defenders’ total strength is 4 (2 basic knights + 1 strong knight).
    number of cities (including ones with a             The Barbarians are victorious.
    metropolis) currently on the board.
  • The defenders’ strength is equal to the
    sum of the strength of all active knights
    currently on the board.

THE BARBARIANS ARE
VICTORIOUS
If the barbarians’ strength is greater than the
defenders’ strength, the barbarians win and
pillage 1 or more cities. Reduce pillaged cities
to settlements by replacing the city piece
with a settlement. If a city with a city wall is
pillaged, the city wall is also removed from the
board. If you do not have any settlements in
your supply, turn the city piece on its side and
treat it as a settlement. You must upgrade this
settlement to a city before upgrading any other
settlement.
   • The player(s) who contributed the lowest
     total strength of active knights has one
     of their cities pillaged. If that player is
     unable to pillage a city, then the player                     2                    2                 1 (metropolis)                0
     who contributed the next lowest total              Active               Active              Active                     Active

     This sequence continues until a city has

     pillaged.                                             which cannot be pillaged. Blue and Red contributed the next

     contributed the lowest total strength.

THE DEFENDERS ARE VICTORIOUS
If the defenders’ strength is greater than or equal to the barbarians’ strength, the knights successfully
drive off the barbarians.
  • The player who contributed the highest total strength of active knights receives a VP token worth 1 VP.
  • If multiple players contributed the same strength, no one receives a VP token. Instead, starting with the player whose
    turn it is, each of the tied players draws a progress card from the deck of their choice.

THE BARBARIANS RETURN HOME
Move the barbarian ship back to the starting position on the barbarian track. Lay all knights down so that they are inactive.

                                                                                                                                            11
COMBINING WITH CATAN – SEAFARERS EXPANSION™
You can combine your Cities & Knights game with CATAN – Seafarers Expansion (aka Seafarers). The best Seafarers
scenarios to use are ones that do not involve the exploration of hidden portions of the board (such as “The Fog Islands”)
or the exploration of many small islands (such as “The Four Islands”) because they noticeably increase the impact of the
barbarian army. Scenarios such as “Heading for New Shores” or “Through the Desert” work well with the rules from
Cities & Knights.
