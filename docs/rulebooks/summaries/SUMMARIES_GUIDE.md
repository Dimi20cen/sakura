# Rulebook Summaries

These are chapter-structured, repo-local summaries of the official rulebooks.

## Files

- `Rulebook-Base-Summary.md`
- `Rulebook-CitiesAndKnights-Summary.md`
- `Rulebook-Seafarers-Summary.md`

## Usage

- Use these files first for fast rule lookup and implementation planning.
- Use `../text/*.txt` for deeper searchable detail.
- Use the PDFs in `../` as final authority when wording/edge cases are ambiguous.
